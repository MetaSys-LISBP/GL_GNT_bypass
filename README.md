# GL_GNT_bypass

This repository contains the model and data used for 13C metabolic flux analysis of the extracellular GL-GNT by-pass of E. coli, as detailed in <REF>. Details on the model structure and on the experiments can be found in the publication.

## Quick-start

The dynamic 13C-flux model can be used to simulate the dynamics of intracellular and extracellular metabolite concentrations. The model is provided in COPASI (`.cps`) and SBML (`.xml`) formats in the folder `model` and is also available in [Biomodels database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) under identifier [MODEL2310250001](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2310250001).

This model can also be used to calculate fluxes by fitting time-course measurements of the concentration of
cells and extracellular (unlabeled and labeled) substrates and products, as detailed in the publication. The data used to calculate fluxes in each 
biological replicate are provided in the folder `data`.
